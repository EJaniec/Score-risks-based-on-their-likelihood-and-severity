<h1>Activity:  Score-risks-based-on-their-likelihood-and-severity</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this lab activity, I engaged in the practice of conducting a risk assessment, systematically evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly pose threats to business operations. The task involved assigning risk scores to each vulnerability, enabling me to make informed decisions on prioritizing resources based on the identified risks. Emphasizing the importance of a security plan in preparedness for potential risks, the activity aligned with the initial steps of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). This voluntary framework, comprising standards, guidelines, and best practices, serves as a comprehensive approach to managing cybersecurity risk. Through the process of risk assessments, I assessed the resilience of security operations against cyber threats, aiming to safeguard sensitive information. Completing this activity was essential before proceeding, as the subsequent course item promises a completed exemplar for comparison, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of my risk assessment efforts.
